DBMS - database management system

1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
It organizes data into tables (relations) composed of rows and columns.

2. Query to create database -
 CREATE DATABASE (name of database);
 USE (name of database);

3. Query to create table in database -
  create table personal_info ( name varchar (20), age int , location varchar (20));

4. Query to insert data in the created table -
   insert into personal_info values ("Shalini", 20, "Delhi"), ("Shreya", 25, "Pune"), ("Sampada", 22, "Patna");

5. Query to show table that has been created -
   select * from personal_info;

6. Query to describe table (to show data as well as datatype of that particular data) -
    desc personal_info;

7. Query to get the data of a particular row -
    select name from personal_info;

8. Query to get the data of those whose age is greater than 25 -
    select * from personal_info where age > 25;

9. Query to edit a particular value in the existing table to a new value -
   Update personal_info set name = 'Kritika' where age = 28;
   and then again write the query select * from personal_info;
   then u will get the updated table as output

10. Query to delete a particular data from the table -
    delete from personal_info where age = 24;
    and the again pass the command  select * from personal_info;
    then u will get the table as output in which that value will be deleted which u have specified in the delete command

There are two different types of commands in MySQL :
DDL (Data definition language)
DML (Data manipulation language) 

DDL (Data definition language)
this command make changes the structure of the table
Create - creates the table
Alter - changes the existing table
Drop - Remove the database
Truncate - Remove the table

DML (Data manipulation language)
this command changes the data inserted in the table
Select - to select the data from the table and give it as output
Update - updates the data of the table
Insert - inserts data inside the table
Delete - deletes the data from the table

we can also write commands using operators as:
select * from personal_info where age >= 23 and age <= 28;
select * from personal_info where age >= 23 or age <= 28;
select * from personal_info where not age >= 23 or age <= 28;
